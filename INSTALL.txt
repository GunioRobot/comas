= Setting up Comas

== Get the code

The first step towards Comas bliss is, of course, getting the Comas
code. You can clone from its public Git repository at:

    git://github.com/gwolf/comas.git

As stable releases arrive, I will also have them for direct download
at our homepage. Comas' homepage is:

    http://www.comas-code.org/

There, you will be able to find latest releases and documentation.

== Base application setup

=== Install the dependencies

Install Comas' dependencies on your system. They are outlined in the
_Dependencies_ section of the #README file - Instead of maintaining two
separate lists (prone to get out of sync), please refer to that file.

=== Set up your database

You should now configure config/database.yml - It is a #YAML file. You
can copy it from config/database.yml.orig and edit to suit your
site. Please note that Comas was developed with PostgreSQL in mind -
It might work with other databases, but nothing is guaranteed. And
then again, why would you want to use anything else? ;-)

Once your database is created, run Rails' _migrations_ to create
Comas' tables:

    $ rake db:migrate

If everything goes well, you should have a working (although minimal
and probably unusable) Comas installation. Congratulations! You now
need to make your system useful.

== First steps for Comas' administration

=== Administrating Comas: Via the command line

As Comas is a Rails application, probably the most powerful
administrative interface is Rails' _interactive console_. Of course,
it will require you to know some Ruby - but it will allow for the
greatest of powers.

To run the interactive console, enter Comas' main directory and type:

    $ ./script/console

=== Administrative user

The first thing you should do -specially if you are not very
comfortable with the interactive console- is to create an
administrative user with enough privileges to do anything else you
will need via the Web front-end.
